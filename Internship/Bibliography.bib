abstract = "Massive and mass-less Yang-Mills and gravitational fields are considered. It is found that there is a discrete difference between the zero-mass theories and the very small, but non-zero mass theories. In the case of gravitation,comparison of massive and mass-less theories with experiment, in particular the perihelion movement of Mercury, leads to exclusion of the massive theory. It is concluded that the graviton mass must be rigorously zero."

The goal of this paper is to make up for this deficit. In particular, it aims to set out the implications of Haag's theorem for scattering theory, the interaction picture, the use of non-Fock representations in describing interacting fields, and the choice among the plethora of the unitarily inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations for free and interacting fields.}
